- **User feedback**: In-app surveys, post-booking feedback, customer support interactions, user interviews, NPS tracking

## 9. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 9.1 Technical Risks
- **Third-party API failures**: DVLA or Stripe outages could prevent bookings; mitigation: caching, fallback options, monitoring
- **Database performance**: High load during peak times; mitigation: query optimization, read replicas, rate limiting
- **Security breaches**: Data leaks or unauthorized access; mitigation: regular audits, encryption, access controls

### 9.2 Business Risks
- **Low garage adoption**: Insufficient partnerships for viable marketplace; mitigation: competitive onboarding incentives, marketing campaigns
- **Regulatory changes**: DVLA policy updates affecting MOT processes; mitigation: active monitoring, flexible system design
- **Market competition**: New entrants or existing players expanding; mitigation: first-mover advantage, customer loyalty programs

### 9.3 User Experience Risks
- **Complex booking process**: User abandonment during booking; mitigation: simplified flows, progress indicators, user testing
- **Poor garage quality**: Inconsistent service standards; mitigation: rating system, quality assurance program, dispute resolution
- **Mobile usability issues**: Poor mobile experience leading to low adoption; mitigation: mobile-first design, extensive testing

### 9.4 Contingency Planning
- **Rollback plan**: Feature flags for quick disablement, database backups, staged deployment strategy
- **Alternative approaches**: Manual booking support, partner API fallbacks, offline capability for critical functions
- **Crisis communication**: User notification system, status page, customer support escalation procedures
