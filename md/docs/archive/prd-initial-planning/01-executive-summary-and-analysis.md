### 1.2 Project Overview
BookaMOT is a modern web application that simplifies the process of booking MOT (Ministry of Transport) tests for vehicles in the UK. It connects vehicle owners with approved MOT testing stations, providing a seamless booking experience with real-time availability, secure payments, and comprehensive management tools for both customers and garage owners.

The platform features user authentication, vehicle management, real-time booking systems, dashboard analytics, and garage administration tools. Built with Next.js and Supabase, it offers a scalable SaaS solution for the UK automotive testing market.

- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduces administrative burden for garages while improving customer experience
- **Revenue Model**: Commission-based model from successful bookings, plus premium features for garages
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture allows rapid expansion across the UK market

### 1.4 Success Definition
Success will be measured by:
- Achieving 1,000 active garage partnerships within 12 months
- Processing 50,000+ MOT bookings annually
- Maintaining 95%+ customer satisfaction rating
- Achieving 99.9% platform uptime
- Generating sustainable revenue through booking commissions and premium subscriptions
