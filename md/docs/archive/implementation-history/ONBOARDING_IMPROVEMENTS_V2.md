## üì¶ Files Modified

### 1. **src/components/onboarding/vehicle-step.tsx**

#### Content Removed:
- ‚ùå Subtitle: "Enter your registration number and we'll look up the details for you"
- ‚ùå Example text: "Try: AB12CDE, WJ11USE, or XY99ZZZ"

#### Form Layout Changes:
**Before (3 rows):**
```
Row 1: Registration Number (full width)
Row 2: Make | Model (2 columns)
Row 3: Year | Fuel Type (2 columns)
```

**After (2 rows):**
```
Row 1: Registration Number (full width)
Row 2: Make | Model | Year | Fuel Type (4 columns)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ More compact layout
- ‚úÖ Better use of horizontal space
- ‚úÖ Faster form completion (less scrolling)
- ‚úÖ Responsive: stacks on mobile, 4 columns on desktop

#### Animation Added:
**Car Drive-In Animation:**
- Car icon drives in from left (-100px ‚Üí 0)
- Bounces on arrival (y: 0 ‚Üí -8 ‚Üí 0)
- Continuous subtle floating (y: -3, infinite loop)
- Duration: 0.8s entrance + 0.6s bounce
- Easing: power2.out + bounce.out

**Code:**
```typescript
// Car drives in from left
tl.from(carContainerRef.current, {
  x: -100,
  opacity: 0,
  duration: 0.8,
  ease: 'power2.out',
})
// Bounce effect
.to(carContainerRef.current, {
  y: -8,
  duration: 0.3,
  ease: 'power1.out',
})
.to(carContainerRef.current, {
  y: 0,
  duration: 0.3,
  ease: 'bounce.out',
})

// Continuous subtle bounce
gsap.to(carIconRef.current, {
  y: -3,
  duration: 1.5,
  ease: 'sine.inOut',
  repeat: -1,
  yoyo: true,
})
```

#### Button Styling Updated:
**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col-reverse md:flex-row gap-3 pt-4">
  <Button className="w-full md:w-auto">Back</Button>
  <Button className="w-full md:flex-1 h-12">Continue</Button>
</div>
```

**After (matches location-step.tsx):**
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 items-center justify-between">
  <Button className="w-full sm:w-auto order-2 sm:order-1">Back</Button>
  <Button className="w-full sm:w-auto group order-1 sm:order-2" size="lg">
    Continue
  </Button>
</div>
```

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Changed `md:` breakpoint to `sm:` for earlier responsive behavior
- ‚úÖ Added `justify-between` for better spacing
- ‚úÖ Added `order-1/order-2` for mobile-first button ordering
- ‚úÖ Added `size="lg"` for consistent sizing
- ‚úÖ Changed gap from `gap-3` to `gap-4`

---

### 2. **src/components/onboarding/location-step.tsx**

#### Content Removed:
- ‚ùå Subtitle: "We'll search for approved garages in your area"
- ‚ùå Helper text under postcode: "Type in your postcode to search nearby garages"
- ‚ùå Helper text under GPS: "Automatically find the closest garages to you"

#### Animation Added:
**Map Pin Drop Animation:**
- Pin drops from above with bounce effect
- Slight rotation wiggle on landing (5¬∞ ‚Üí -5¬∞ ‚Üí 0¬∞)
- Continuous pulsing ring effect (radar-style)
- Subtle floating animation (infinite loop)

**Animation Timeline:**
```
1. Pin drops from -60px with bounce (0.6s)
2. Rotates right 5¬∞ (0.15s)
3. Rotates left -5¬∞ (0.15s)
4. Returns to 0¬∞ (0.15s)
5. Continuous pulse ring (2s, infinite)
6. Continuous float (2s, infinite, yoyo)
```

**Code:**
```typescript
// Pin drops from above
tl.from(mapPinIconRef.current, {
  y: -60,
  opacity: 0,
  duration: 0.6,
  ease: 'bounce.out',
})
// Rotation wiggle
.to(mapPinIconRef.current, {
  rotation: 5,
  duration: 0.15,
  ease: 'power2.out',
})
.to(mapPinIconRef.current, {
  rotation: -5,
  duration: 0.15,
  ease: 'power2.inOut',
})
.to(mapPinIconRef.current, {
  rotation: 0,
  duration: 0.15,
  ease: 'power2.out',
})

// Continuous pulsing ring
gsap.to(pulseRingRef.current, {
  scale: 1.5,
  opacity: 0,
  duration: 2,
  ease: 'power1.out',
  repeat: -1,
  repeatDelay: 0.5,
})

// Subtle floating
gsap.to(mapPinIconRef.current, {
  y: -4,
  duration: 2,
  ease: 'sine.inOut',
  repeat: -1,
  yoyo: true,
  delay: 1,
})
```

**Visual Elements Added:**
```tsx
<div className="relative w-16 h-16 bg-primary/10 rounded-full">
  {/* Pulsing ring effect */}
  <div 
    ref={pulseRingRef}
    className="absolute inset-0 rounded-full bg-primary/30"
  />
  <MapPin ref={mapPinIconRef} className="w-8 h-8 text-primary relative z-10" />
</div>
```

## üé® Animation Specifications

### Vehicle Step - Car Animation
- **Type:** Drive-in + bounce + float
- **Duration:** 0.8s entrance, 0.6s bounce, 1.5s float (infinite)
- **Easing:** power2.out, bounce.out, sine.inOut
- **Effect:** Car drives in from left, bounces on arrival, floats continuously

### Location Step - Map Pin Animation
- **Type:** Drop + wiggle + pulse + float
- **Duration:** 0.6s drop, 0.45s wiggle, 2s pulse (infinite), 2s float (infinite)
- **Easing:** bounce.out, power2.out, power1.out, sine.inOut
- **Effect:** Pin drops from above, wiggles on landing, pulses radar rings, floats subtly

### Accessibility
Both animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:
```javascript
const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches

if (prefersReducedMotion) {
  return // Skip animations
}
```
