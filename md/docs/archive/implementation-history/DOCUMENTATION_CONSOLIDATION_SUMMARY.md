## Documentation Standards

### Official Flow Documentation (`md/docs/app-flows/`)

**Purpose:** Document the **current state** of user flows

**Structure:**
1. Purpose & Scope
2. Implementation Guidelines
3. Mermaid Diagrams
4. Detailed Steps
5. API Endpoints
6. Error Handling
7. Testing Scenarios
8. Related Documentation

**Maintenance:**
- Update when flows change
- Keep accurate and current
- Single source of truth

---

### Historical Documentation (`md/docs/archive/implementation-history/`)

**Purpose:** Preserve **implementation history** and **bug fixes**

**Content:**
- How features were built
- Problems encountered and solved
- Iterative improvements
- Lessons learned

**Usage:**
- Reference for understanding past decisions
- Learning from past bugs
- Training new developers
- Historical context

**Maintenance:**
- Read-only (no updates)
- Add new files only when archiving
- Do not use for current system understanding

---

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

**Before (Old Way):**
```
Need to understand booking flow
  ↓
Search through 4 different BOOKING_FLOW_*.md files
  ↓
Find conflicting information
  ↓
Confused about current state
```

**After (New Way):**
```
Need to understand booking flow
  ↓
Read md/docs/app-flows/booking-flow.md
  ↓
Clear, current, comprehensive information
  ↓
Understand the flow completely
```
