# Implementation History Archive

## Purpose

This folder contains historical documentation of implementation details, bug fixes, and iterative improvements made during the development of BookaMOT. These files document the **journey** of building features, not the **current state** of the application.

---

## Why Archive These Files?

### ✅ **Preserved for Reference**
- Historical context of how features were built
- Bug fixes and their solutions
- Iterative improvements and lessons learned
- Useful for understanding past decisions

### ❌ **Not Current Documentation**
- May contain outdated information
- Describes problems that have been solved
- Multiple files about the same topic (showing evolution)
- Not suitable for understanding current system behavior

---

## When to Use These Files

### ✅ **Good Use Cases:**
- Understanding why a specific decision was made
- Learning from past bugs and their solutions
- Researching how a feature evolved over time
- Training new developers on the development process

### ❌ **Bad Use Cases:**
- Understanding current system behavior (use official docs)
- Implementing new features (use current codebase)
- Troubleshooting current issues (use official docs + code)
- Onboarding new team members (use official docs first)
