‚úÖ Data filtered by garage ownership  
‚úÖ No cross-garage data leakage  
‚úÖ CSV export respects current filters  
‚úÖ Proper error handling and validation  

---

## üìà Performance Notes

- Detail pages load customer/vehicle data on demand
- Filtering is done server-side for scalability
- CSV export is client-side (no server load)
- Pagination limits to 10 items per page
- MOT status calculated efficiently
