# Booking Flow Implementation - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Search Results Page (`src/app/search-results/page.tsx`)

**Added Imports:**
- `useRouter` from `next/navigation`
- `useSession` from `next-auth/react`

**New State:**
- `isCheckingVehicles` - tracks vehicle verification status

**New Functions:**
- `storeBookingContext(garageId, timeSlot?)` - stores search context in session storage
- `checkUserVehicles()` - fetches user's vehicles from API
- `handleBookNow(garageId, timeSlot?)` - implements 3-step authentication and booking flow

**Updated UI:**
- "Book Now" buttons now show loading state ("Checking..." / "...")
- Buttons disabled during vehicle verification

### 2. Vehicle Add Page (`src/app/vehicles/add/page.tsx`)

**New Functions:**
- `getBookingContext()` - retrieves booking context from session storage

**Updated `handleSubmit()`:**
- After vehicle creation, checks for booking context
- If context exists: redirects to `/booking/[garageId]` with parameters
- If no context: redirects to `/dashboard` (normal flow)
- Clears booking context after redirect

**Updated UI:**
- Added informational message when in booking flow
- Message: "Booking in progress: After adding your vehicle, you'll be redirected to complete your MOT booking."

## Implementation Flow

### Step 1: Authentication Check
```
User clicks "Book Now"
  ↓
Is user authenticated?
  ├─ NO → Store context → Redirect to /signin with return URL
  └─ YES → Go to Step 2
```

### Step 2: Vehicle Verification
```
User is authenticated
  ↓
Does user have vehicles?
  ├─ NO → Store context → Redirect to /vehicles/add
  └─ YES → Go to Step 3
```

### Step 3: Booking Page
```
User has vehicles
  ↓
Redirect to /booking/[garageId] with search parameters
```

## Session Storage

**Key:** `bookingSearchContext`

**Data Stored:**
```json
{
  "postcode": "string",
  "lat": "string",
  "lng": "string",
  "date": "string",
  "time": "string",
  "isQuick": "boolean",
  "selectedGarageId": "string",
  "selectedTimeSlot": "string | null",
  "timestamp": "string"
}
```

**Lifecycle:**
- Created when user clicks "Book Now"
- Persists across redirects
- Cleared after successful vehicle registration
- NOT cleared on authentication redirect (intentional)

## Key Features

✅ **Authentication Check** - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
✅ **Vehicle Verification** - Ensures user has registered vehicles
✅ **Context Preservation** - All search parameters preserved across redirects
✅ **Seamless Flow** - Users return to booking after login/vehicle registration
✅ **Loading States** - Visual feedback during vehicle check
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks for API failures
✅ **User Communication** - Info message about booking progress

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/search-results/page.tsx` - Main booking flow implementation
2. `src/app/vehicles/add/page.tsx` - Vehicle registration redirect handling

## Files Created

1. `md/docs/BOOKING_FLOW_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed technical documentation
2. `md/docs/BOOKING_FLOW_TESTING.md` - Testing guide and scenarios
3. `md/docs/BOOKING_FLOW_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Unauthenticated user redirects to signin
- [ ] Return URL preserves search parameters
- [ ] Authenticated user without vehicles redirects to /vehicles/add
- [ ] Info message displays on vehicle add page
- [ ] After vehicle registration, redirects to /booking/[garageId]
- [ ] Authenticated user with vehicles goes directly to booking
- [ ] Time slot selection is preserved
- [ ] Session storage is cleared after vehicle registration
- [ ] Error handling works for API failures

## Next Steps

1. Run the application: `npm run dev`
2. Test the booking flow manually
3. Verify session storage behavior in browser DevTools
4. Test with different user scenarios
5. Monitor API response times
6. Consider adding unit tests for the new functions

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No database schema changes required
- Uses existing authentication system (NextAuth)
- Uses existing vehicle API endpoints
- Session storage is browser-based (no server-side state)
