# App Flows Documentation

This folder contains structured documentation for application flows using Mermaid diagrams.

## Instructions

The creation and organization of all files in this folder must strictly follow best practices for documenting user and system flows. Use Mermaid for sequence diagrams and maintain a consistent structure: Purpose & Scope, Implementation Guidelines, and Mermaid Diagram.

## Structure

- `main-flow.md` - Primary application flow
- `auth-flow.md` - Authentication processes
- `ai-flow.md` - AI interaction flows
- Additional flows as needed (e.g., payment-flow.md, user-profile-flow.md)

## Reference

Refer to the `docs/app-flows.md` file or general documentation guidelines for templates, rules, and best practices. Adapt examples to project-specific needs while keeping content in English except for Portuguese variables.
