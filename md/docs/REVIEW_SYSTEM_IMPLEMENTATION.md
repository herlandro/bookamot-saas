## üîÑ Review System Logic

### Two-Way Review System
- **Customers review Garages**: After booking completion, customer can review the garage and service experience
- **Garages review Customers**: After marking booking as completed, garage owner can review the customer

### Authorization
- Only booking participants can create reviews
- Customer can only review the garage they booked with
- Garage owner can only review the customer who made the booking
- Unique constraint on `bookingId` prevents duplicate reviews

### Rating Calculation
- Automatic calculation of average ratings when reviews are created or updated
- Average ratings stored in User and Garage models for performance
- Recalculated whenever a review is added or modified

### Edit Window
- Users can edit their reviews within 7 days of creation
- After 7 days, reviews become read-only
- Average ratings are recalculated after edits

## üìä Data Flow

1. **Booking Completion**: Garage owner marks booking as COMPLETED
2. **Review Modal Trigger**: ReviewSubmissionModal appears for garage owner
3. **Review Submission**: Garage owner submits rating and optional comment
4. **Database Update**: Review created, average ratings calculated and stored
5. **Display**: Ratings visible on customer detail page and search results

## üéØ Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Email Notifications**: Send email when reviews are received
2. **Customer Review Flow**: Create flow for customers to review garages (currently only garage can review customer)
3. **Review Moderation**: Admin tools to moderate or remove inappropriate reviews
4. **Review Analytics**: Dashboard showing review trends and insights
5. **Review Filtering**: Filter reviews by rating, date range, etc.

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

1. Test review submission with valid and invalid data
2. Test authorization (ensure only booking participants can review)
3. Test duplicate review prevention
4. Test average rating calculation with multiple reviews
5. Test review editing within 7-day window
6. Test review display on customer detail page
7. Test pagination of reviews
8. Test responsive design on mobile devices

## üìù Translation Status

All text is in English:
- "Rating", "Reviews", "Write a Review", "Average Rating", "No reviews yet"
- "Review submitted successfully!", "Submit Review", "Cancel"
- "Reviews from Garages", "Reviews written by garages about this customer"

## üîê Security Considerations

- Server-side authentication checks on all endpoints
- Authorization validation ensures users can only review/edit their own reviews
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- Rate limiting recommended for production
