# Mistakes Documentation

This directory contains error documentation following the memory management protocol.

## Purpose

Each file in this directory logs resolved errors, mistakes, and their solutions to prevent repetition and improve AI performance over time.

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive kebab-case names by error category: `[error-category].md`
- Examples: `database-errors.md`, `authentication-issues.md`, `api-integration-problems.md`

## Template Structure

Each mistake documentation should include:

### Problem Description
- Clear description of what went wrong
- Symptoms observed
- Context when the error occurred

### Wrong Approach
- What was initially tried
- Why it didn't work
- Misconceptions or assumptions made

### Correct Solution
- Step-by-step solution that worked
- Code examples if applicable
- Configuration changes needed

### Root Cause Analysis
- Why the error occurred
- Underlying technical reasons
- Environmental factors

### Prevention Strategy
- How to avoid this error in the future
- Best practices to follow
- Warning signs to watch for

### Related Files
- Files that were modified to fix the issue
- Documentation that was updated
- Tests that were added

### Date and Context
- When the error was resolved
- Project or feature context
- Team member or AI session involved

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Log Immediately**: Document errors as soon as they're resolved
2. **Be Specific**: Include enough detail for future reference
3. **Update Existing**: If similar errors occur, update existing entries
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related features, APIs, or database schemas
5. **Learn**: Review before starting similar work to avoid repetition
