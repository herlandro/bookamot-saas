# API Documentation Files

This folder contains individual API documentation files for the project.

## Purpose

Each file in this directory documents specific API endpoints or groups of related endpoints. Files should be organized by functionality or domain (e.g., events, authentication, participants).

## Guidelines

- Each file should not exceed 250 lines for readability
- Use descriptive filenames that reflect functionality
- Follow the documentation structure defined in `docs/apis.md`
- Group related endpoints in the same file when appropriate

## Example Files

Here are some examples of how you might organize your API documentation files:

- `events-list-create.md` - Event listing and creation
- `events-crud.md` - CRUD operations for individual events
- `events-participants.md` - Participant management
- `events-duplicate.md` - Event duplication
- `categories.md` - Category listing
- `auth.md` - Authentication endpoints

Refer to `../apis.md` for detailed documentation guidelines and examples.
