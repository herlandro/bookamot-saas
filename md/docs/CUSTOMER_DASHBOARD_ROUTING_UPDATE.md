# Customer Dashboard Routing Update

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Summary

Updated the customer sidebar and navigation menu to ensure consistent routing and icon usage across the application. The changes consolidate the customer dashboard access to use the `/dashboard` route exclusively and standardize the Dashboard icon to `LayoutDashboard` for consistency with the garage admin sidebar.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Customer Sidebar (`src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`)

#### Menu Item Update
```typescript
// Before
{ id: 'home', label: 'Home', icon: Home, href: '/' }

// After
{ id: 'dashboard', label: 'Dashboard', icon: LayoutDashboard, href: '/dashboard' }
```

**Changes:**
- Changed menu item id from `'home'` to `'dashboard'`
- Changed label from `'Home'` to `'Dashboard'`
- Changed icon from `Home` to `LayoutDashboard`
- Changed href from `/` to `/dashboard`

#### Import Updates
```typescript
// Before
import {
  Menu,
  X,
  Home,
  Search,
  Calendar,
  MessageSquare,
  LogOut,
  Car,
  Star
} from 'lucide-react';
import { signOut } from 'next-auth/react';

// After
import {
  Menu,
  X,
  Calendar,
  Car,
  Star,
  LayoutDashboard
} from 'lucide-react';
```

**Removed unused imports:**
- `Home` - No longer used
- `Search` - Not used
- `MessageSquare` - Not used
- `LogOut` - Not used
- `signOut` from 'next-auth/react' - Not used

### 2. Navigation Menu (`src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx`)

#### Customer Navigation Dashboard Icon Update
```typescript
// Before
{
  name: 'Dashboard',
  href: '/dashboard',
  icon: Home,
  description: 'Visão geral da conta'
}

// After
{
  name: 'Dashboard',
  href: '/dashboard',
  icon: LayoutDashboard,
  description: 'Visão geral da conta'
}
```

**Changes:**
- Changed Dashboard icon from `Home` to `LayoutDashboard`
- Href remains `/dashboard` (already correct)

#### Import Updates
```typescript
// Before
import {
  Home,
  Calendar,
  BookOpen,
  Users,
  Car,
  Star,
  LayoutDashboard
} from 'lucide-react'

// After
import {
  Calendar,
  BookOpen,
  Users,
  Car,
  Star,
  LayoutDashboard
} from 'lucide-react'
```

**Removed unused imports:**
- `Home` - No longer used

## Icon Consistency

### Dashboard Icons Across Application

| Component | Icon | Route |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Customer Sidebar | `LayoutDashboard` | `/dashboard` |
| Customer Navigation Menu | `LayoutDashboard` | `/dashboard` |
| Garage Sidebar | `LayoutDashboard` | `/garage-admin/dashboard` |
| Garage Navigation Menu | `LayoutDashboard` | `/garage-admin/dashboard` |

✅ **All Dashboard icons are now consistent using `LayoutDashboard`**

## Testing Checklist

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Routing**: Customer dashboard is now accessed exclusively via `/dashboard` route
2. **Icon Consistency**: All Dashboard items use the same `LayoutDashboard` icon
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed unused imports and simplified component structure
4. **Better UX**: Sidebar now clearly shows "Dashboard" instead of "Home"
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and maintain routing structure

---

## Backward Compatibility

⚠️ **Breaking Changes:**
- Sidebar link now points to `/dashboard` instead of `/`
- Users bookmarking the sidebar link will need to update

✅ **Preserved:**
- Root `/` route still works and shows appropriate content
- All customer functionality remains unchanged
- All garage admin functionality remains unchanged

---

## Notes

- The root `/` page still works and shows appropriate content based on user role
- The `/dashboard` route is now the primary customer dashboard route
- Icon consistency improves visual coherence across the application
- All changes are backward compatible for users accessing routes directly

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND TESTED
