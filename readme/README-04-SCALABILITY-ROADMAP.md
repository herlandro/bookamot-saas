# Scalability Roadmap - BookaMOT

This document presents a structured plan to improve the scalability and code quality of the BookaMOT project, based on the analysis of the source code and documentation.

## Phase 1: Automated Tests (High Priority)

### Objectives
- Ensure code quality as the project grows
- Facilitate refactoring and new implementations
- Prevent regressions

### Tasks
1. **Configure Jest for unit tests**
   - Install Jest and configure with TypeScript
   - Create directory structure for tests (`__tests__` or `/tests`)
   - Implement tests for utility functions in `/src/lib/utils.ts`
   - Implement tests for validations in `/src/lib/validations.ts`

2. **Implement React component tests**
   - Configure React Testing Library
   - Test main UI components (forms, calendars, etc.)
   - Test custom hooks

3. **Configure integration tests**
   - Test complete API flows
   - Test database interactions using a test database

4. **Implement E2E tests with Cypress**
   - Configure Cypress
   - Create tests for critical flows:
     - User registration and login
     - Vehicle addition
     - Garage search
     - MOT scheduling
     - Garage administration flow

## Phase 2: CI/CD and Containerization (High Priority)

### Objectives
- Automate testing and deployment processes
- Ensure consistency across environments
- Facilitate horizontal scalability

### Tasks
1. **Configure GitHub Actions**
   - Create workflow to run tests on each PR
   - Configure lint and type checking
   - Implement verification build

2. **Containerize the application**
   - Create optimized Dockerfile
   - Configure docker-compose.yml for development
   - Document build and execution process

3. **Configure deployment environments**
   - Define configurations for dev, staging, and production
   - Implement environment variables per environment
   - Configure automated database migration process

## Phase 3: Monitoring and Logging (Medium Priority)

### Objectives
- Quickly identify and resolve issues
- Monitor application performance
- Track errors in production

### Tasks
1. **Implement Sentry for error tracking**
   - Configure Sentry SDK
   - Implement error capture in React components
   - Configure error capture in APIs

2. **Configure structured logging**
   - Implement logging library (such as Winston or Pino)
   - Define appropriate log levels
   - Configure log rotation

3. **Implement performance metrics**
   - Monitor API response time
   - Track database query performance
   - Implement resource usage metrics

## Phase 4: Cache and Performance Optimization (Medium Priority)

### Objectives
- Improve response time
- Reduce database load
- Optimize user experience

### Tasks
1. **Implement Redis for cache**
   - Configure Redis as a service
   - Implement cache for frequently accessed data:
     - Garage search results
     - Availability data
     - User information

2. **Optimize database queries**
   - Review and optimize Prisma queries
   - Implement appropriate indexes
   - Resolve N+1 query problems

3. **Implement Next.js caching strategies**
   - Use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for semi-static pages
   - Configure API route caching
   - Implement revalidation strategies

4. **Optimize frontend loading**
   - Implement lazy loading of components
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Implement code splitting

## Phase 5: Security and Protection (Medium Priority)

### Objectives
- Protect sensitive data
- Prevent common attacks
- Ensure compliance with regulations

### Tasks
1. **Implement rate limiting**
   - Configure protection against abuse on sensitive endpoints
   - Implement brute force protection for authentication

2. **Review and improve security practices**
   - Audit dependencies with `npm audit`
   - Implement Content Security Policy
   - Review CORS configurations

3. **Implement additional validations**
   - Strengthen input validations in APIs
   - Implement data sanitization

## Phase 6: Database Scalability (Low Priority)

### Objectives
- Prepare for data growth
- Improve query performance
- Ensure availability

### Tasks
1. **Configure connection pooling**
   - Optimize Prisma configurations for connection pooling
   - Configure appropriate limits

2. **Plan sharding/partitioning strategy**
   - Identify candidates for partitioning (e.g., historical data)
   - Document strategy for future implementation

3. **Implement backup and recovery strategy**
   - Configure automatic backups
   - Test recovery process
   - Document procedures

## Success Metrics

- **Test coverage**: Achieve at least 80% coverage
- **Deployment time**: Reduce to less than 10 minutes
- **API response time**: Maintain below 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Page load time**: Maintain below 2 seconds for 95% of users
- **Error rate**: Maintain below 0.1% in production

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Start Jest configuration and first unit tests
2. Create basic Dockerfile for the application
3. Configure GitHub Actions for test execution
4. Implement Sentry for error tracking
